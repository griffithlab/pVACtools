Output Files
============

The pVACbind pipeline will write its results in separate folders depending on
which prediction algorithms were chosen:

- ``MHC_Class_I``: for MHC class I prediction algorithms
- ``MHC_Class_II``: for MHC class II prediction algorithms
- ``combined``: If both MHC class I and MHC class II prediction algorithms were run, this folder combines the neoepitope predictions from both

Each folder will contain the same list of output files (listed in the order
created):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File Name
     - Description
   * - ``<sample_name>.all_epitopes.tsv``
     - A list of all predicted epitopes and their binding affinity scores, with
       additional variant information from the ``<sample_name>.tsv``.
   * - ``<sample_name>.filtered.tsv``
     - The above file after applying all filters, with cleavage site and stability
       predictions added.
   * - ``<sample_name>.filtered.tsv.reference_matches`` (optional)
     - A file outlining details of reference proteome matches
   * - ``<sample_name>.all_epitopes.aggregated.tsv``
     - An aggregated version of the ``all_epitopes.tsv`` file that gives information about
       the best epitope for each mutation in an easy-to-read format.

Filters applied to the filtered.tsv file
----------------------------------------

The filtered.tsv file is the all_epitopes file with the following filters
applied (in order):

- Binding Filter
- Top Score Filter

Please see the :ref:`Standalone Filter Commands<pvacbind_filter_commands>`
documentation for more information on each individual filter. The standalone
filter commands may be useful to reproduce the filtering or to chose different
filtering thresholds.

Prediction Algorithms Supporting Percentile Information
_______________________________________________________

pVACbind outputs binding affinity percentile rank information when provided by
a chosen prediction algorithm. The following prediction algorithms calculate a
percentile rank:

MHCnuggets
MHCnuggets
- MHCflurry
- NetMHC
- NetMHCcons
- NetMHCpan
- NetMHCIIpan
- NNalign
- PickPocket
- SMM
- SMMPMBEC
- SMMalign

The following prediction algorithms do not provide a percentile rank:

- MHCnuggets

.. _pvacbind_aggregated:

all_epitopes.aggregated.tsv Report Columns
--------------------------------------------

The ``all_epitopes.aggregated.tsv`` file is an aggregated version of the all_epitopes TSV.
Like the all_epitopes.tsv and filtered.tsv reports, in order to keep the outputs consistent,
pVACbind uses the same output columns as pVACseq for this file but some of the values will
be ``NA`` if a column doesn't apply to pVACbind.
This report presents the best-scoring (lowest binding affinity)
epitope for each variant and outputs additional binding affinity for that epitope.
It also gives information about the total number of well-scoring epitopes for each variant,
as well as the HLA alleles that those epitopes are well-binding to.
