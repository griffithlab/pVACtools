Version 4.4

Version 4.4.0
-------------

This is a minor feature release. It adds the following features:

- Various updates to the pVACview main interface:

  - Users can no select a row to investigate by clicking on the row
  - Users are now able to select an evaluation for a candidate by clicking on
    one of three buttons on the right of the candidate's row.

- Various updates to the pVACview NeoFox interface:

  - By default, only a subset of NeoFox columns will be shown in order to
    reduce the width of the table. Additional columns can be enabled by
    selecting them in the "Column visibility" dropdown.
  - We have added heatmap cell backgrounds to IC50 binding affinity and rank
    columns.
  - We have added horizontal barplot background to VAF and expression columns.
  - Users are now able to select an evaluation for each candidate.
  - Users are now able to leave a comment on selected candidates.
  - The NeoFox table, including the selected evaluations and comments, can now
    be exported in TSV and excel format.

This release also fixes the following bug(s):

- A previous change would no longer allow standalone alpha/beta chain DP and DQ alleles. This change
  would filter out such alleles before trying to combine them into valid
  alpha-beta-chain pairs. This update once again enables automatic combination
  of DP and DQ alleles in to alpha and beta chain pairs.
