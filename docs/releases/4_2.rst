Version 4.2
===========

Version 4.2.0
-------------

This is a minor feature release. It adds the following features:

- We added two new modules to pVACview: a :ref:`neofox_module` to visualize
  NeoFox neoantigen annotations and a :ref:`custom_module` to visualize
  neoantigen data in a TSV file, for example output files from VaxRank,
  NeoPredPipe, or antigen.garnish.2.
- We added a :ref:`vignette <pvacseq_vignette>` to our documentation to provide
  an extended tutorial on how evaluate neoantigen candidates using pVACview.

This release also fixes the following bug(s):

- When running pVACfuse with Arriba input data, the 3' transcript was not
  being parsed correctly. This release fixes this issue.
