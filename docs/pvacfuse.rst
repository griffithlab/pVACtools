pVACfuse
====================================

This component of the pVACtools workflow provides support for predicting
neoantigens from gene fusions. Currently, annotated fusion variants as reported by
`AGFusion <https://github.com/murphycj/AGFusion>`_ and `Arriba <https://github.com/suhrig/arriba>`_ are supported, 
and any of the binding affinity prediction software available in pVACseq can 
be used for binding prediction.
