pVACfuse
====================================

This component of the pVACtools workflow provides support for predicting
neoantigens from gene fusions. Currently, fusion variants as reported by
`INTEGRATE-Neo <https://github.com/ChrisMaherLab/INTEGRATE-Neo>`_ are supported, 
and any of the binding affinity prediction software available in pVACseq can 
be used for binding prediction.
