Output Files
============

The pVACfuse pipeline will write its results in separate folders depending on
which prediction algorithms were chosen:

- ``MHC_Class_I``: for MHC class I prediction algorithms
- ``MHC_Class_II``: for MHC class II prediction algorithms
- ``combined``: If both MHC class I and MHC class II prediction algorithms were run, this folder combines the neoepitope predictions from both

Each folder will contain the same list of output files (listed in the order
created):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

     - Description
   * - ``<sample_name>.tsv``

     - The above file but split into smaller chunks for easier processing with IEDB.
   * - ``<sample_name>.fasta``
     - A fasta file with mutant peptide subsequences for all
       processable fusion combinations.
   * - ``<sample_name>.net_chop.fa``

   * - ``<sample_name>.all_epitopes.tsv``
     - A list of all predicted epitopes and their binding affinity scores, with
       additional variant information from the ``<sample_name>.tsv``.
   * - ``<sample_name>.filtered.tsv``
     - The above file after applying all filters, with cleavage site and stability
       predictions added.
   * - ``<sample_name>.all_epitopes.aggregated.tsv``
     - An aggregated version of the ``all_epitopes.tsv`` file that gives information about
       the best epitope for each mutation in an easy-to-read format. Not generated when running with elution algorithms only.
   * - ``<sample_name>.all_epitopes.aggregated.tsv.reference_matches`` (optional)
     - A file outlining details of reference proteome matches

Filters applied to the filtered.tsv file
----------------------------------------

The filtered.tsv file is the all_epitopes file with the following filters
applied (in order):

- Binding Filter
- Coverage Filter
- Top Score Filter

Please see the :ref:`Standalone Filter Commands<pvacfuse_filter_commands>`
documentation for more information on each individual filter. The standalone
filter commands may be useful to reproduce the filtering or to chose different
filtering thresholds.

all_epitopes.aggregated.tsv Report Columns
--------------------------------------------

The ``all_epitopes.aggregated.tsv`` file is an aggregated version of the all_epitopes TSV.
It shows the best-scoring epitope
for each variant, and outputs additional binding affinity, expression, and
coverage information for that epitope. It also gives information about the
total number of well-scoring epitopes for each variant as well as the HLA alleles that those
epitopes are well-binding to. Lastly, the report will bin variants into tiers
that offer suggestions as to the suitability of variants for use in vaccines.

Only epitopes meeting the ``--aggregate-inclusion-threshold`` are included in this report (default: 5000).
Whether the median or the lowest binding affinity metrics are output in the
``IC50 MT`` and ``%ile MT`` columns is controlled by the
``--top-score-metric`` parameter.

Tiering Parameters
******************

To tier the Best Peptide, several cutoffs can be adjusted using parameters
provided to the pVACfuse run:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
     - Default
   * - ``--binding-threshold``
     - The threshold used for filtering epitopes on the IC50 MT binding affinity.
     - 500
   * - ``--allele-specific-binding-thresholds``
     - Instead of the hard cutoff set by the ``--binding-threshold``, use
       allele-specific binding thresholds. For alleles where no
       allele-specific binding threshold is available, use the
       ``--binding-threshold`` as a fallback. To print a list of alleles that have
       specific binding thresholds and the value of those thresholds, run ``pvacfuse allele_specific_cutoffs``.
     - False
   * - ``--percentile-threshold``
     - When set, use this threshold to filter epitopes on the %ile MT score in addition to having to meet the binding threshold.
     - None
   * - ``--read-support``
     - The threshold used for filtering epitopes on the Read Support.
     - 5
   * - ``--expn-val``
     - The threshold used for filtering epitopes on the Expr.
     - 0.1

Tiers
*****

Given the thresholds provided above, the Best Peptide is evaluated and binned
into tiers as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tier
     - Criteria
   * - ``Pass``
     - Best Peptide passes the binding, read support, and expression criteria
   * - ``LowReadSupport``
     - Best Peptide fails the read support criteria but passes the binding and
       expression criteria
   * - ``LowExpr``
     - Best Peptide fails the expression criteria but passes the binding and
       read support criteria
   * - ``Poor``
     - Best Peptide doesn't fit any of the above tiers, usually if it fails two
       or more criteria or if it fails the binding criteria

Criteria Details
****************

.. list-table::

   * - Binding Criteria
     - Pass if Best Peptide is strong binder
     - ``IC50 MT < binding_threshold`` and ``%ile MT < percentile_threshold``
       (if ``--percentile-threshold`` parameter is set)
   * - Read Support Criteria
     - Pass if the variant has read support
     - ``Read Support < read_support``
   * - Expression Criteria
     - Pass if Best Transcript is expressed
