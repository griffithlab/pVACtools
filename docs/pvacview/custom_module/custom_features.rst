Dynamic Scatter Plot
____________________

The data can be further investigated by using the **Dynamic Scatter Plot** where users can choose any feature to be the X-axis, Y-axis,
color, or size variable. The X and Y scale can be transformed and a range of values subsetted. The color represents the minimum
and maximum values and can also be changed to any HEX value.

To view information about different points on the plot simply mouse over individual points. Users can export the current scatter plot
by using the camera icon at the top right corner of the plot.
