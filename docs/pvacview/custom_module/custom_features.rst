:large:`Dynamic Scatter Plot`
_____________________________________

You can also further investigate the data using the dynamic scatter plot where you can choose any feature to be the X-axis, Y-axis,
color, or size variable. The X and Y scale can be transformed and a range of values subsetted. The color represents the minimum
and maximum values can also be changed to any HEX value. 

To view information about different points on the plot simply mouse over individual points. You can also export the current scatter plot 
by using the camera icon at the top right corner of the plot.
