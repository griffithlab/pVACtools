---------------
In this vignette, we will demonstrate evaluation of neoantigen candidates predicted by pVACseq with pVACview using the built-in demo data. The demonstration dataset includes Class I and Class II neoantigen candidate files generated from the HCC1395 breast cancer cell line and its matched lymphoblastoid cell line HCC1395BL. You can also download the demo data `here <https://github.com/griffithlab/pVACtools/tree/master/pvactools/tools/pvacview/data>`_.

The top row of the page has 4 sections: 

- Advanced Options: Regenerate Tiering with different parameters
- Original Parameters for Tiering
- Current Parameters for Tiering
- Add Comments for selected variant

pVACview prioritizes neoantigen candidates by ranking these peptides based on a set of rules (parameters for tiering), which include variant allele fraction cutoff, gene/transcript expression, binding affinity predictions and more as discussed later. Based on routine criteria evidenced by the literature, we provide a default set of parameters for tiering, detailed in **Original Parameters for Tiering** section. The default is a good starting point, but as all samples are unique in terms of sample quality, sequencing quality, tumor purity, tumor mutation burden, HLA type, you may also want to set your own parameters in the **Advanced Options: Regenerate Tiering with different parameters** section. To see the real-time set of rules applied to your data, see **Current Parameters for Tiering** section.
Note: click the ``+``/ ``-`` in the right corner to expand/retract each section. 

The original parameters rank candidates on multiple facets.
The first aspect is clonality. Cancer starts with a founding clone with tumor-initiating mutations which expand and drive malignancy. Descendents of the founding clone may acquire additional mutations. Clonal mutations are shared by all clones, whereas subclonal mutations are shared by some but not all cancer cells. Neoantigen candidates derived from clonal variants should be prioritized as we expect targeting such mutations will drive a better clinical response. pVACview uses the following parameters when determining clonality:

- ``Tumor Purity`` : a value between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of tumor cells in the tumor sample. (default: None)
- ``VAF Clonal`` : Tumor DNA variant allele frequency (VAF) to determine whether the variant is clonal. (default: 0.5)
- ``VAF Subclonal`` : Tumor DNA VAF cutoff to determine whether the variant is subclonal. This value is automatically calculated as half of ``VAF Clonal``. (default: 0.25)

The second aspect is expression. The ideal peptide candidate should be derived from a gene/transcript that is expressed robustly. We calculate allele expression by multiplying gene expression by the RNA VAF and set a default cutoff of 2. Variants with expression lower than this cutoff will be marked with low expression. Users can adjust this cutoff based on their own knowledge of the dataset being analyzed:

- ``Allele Expression for Passing Variants`` : allele expression cutoff for passing variants. (default: 2 FPKM)

The third aspect is predicted binding affinity, which is measured by IC50 (peptide concentration required for 50% of inhibition for peptide binding to MHC). Lower IC50 means a lower peptide concentration is required to overcome inhibitors and bind to MHC, which signifies better binding affinity. The default cutoff for strong binders is set to 500nM. We also list the `Binding threshold for inclusion into Metric File which is a parameter used upstream to determine how many peptides the user wants to include in the peptide detailed view. Note that this parameter cannot be changed in the visualization component of pVACview but would need to be changed when generating the original aggregate report and metrics file. The default cutoff was set to 5000nM to reasonably capture information about different peptide candidates from the same mutation but also to exclude those that have extremely poor binding.
- ``Binding Threshold``: IC50 value cutoff for a passing neoantigen. (default: 500 nM)
- ``Binding Threshold for Inclusion Into Metric File``: IC50 value cutoff for neoantigens to be loaded to pVACview. This feature helps limit the number of neoantigens being loaded to pVACview. (default: 5000 nM)
The fourth aspect is Transcript Support Level (`TSL <https://useast.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/transcript_quality_tags.html>`_). TSL highlights which transcript isoform is well/poorly-supported by alignment. The existing TSL levels are: TSL1, TSL2, TSL3, TSKL4, TSL5, TSLNA, with TSL1 being the best TSL level.  We suggest users using a higher TSL cutoff for higher confidence in the annotation of the targeted transcript. Default is set to be TSL1. - ``Maximum TSL`` : cutoff TSL level for a passing candidate. (default: 1)

Additionally, users have the option to consider percentile ranks on top of raw IC50 predictions. Percentile rank is a method used to predict binding affinity of a peptide by comparing it to a set of peptides with similar sizes. A lower percentile rank indicates stronger affinity. Percentile rank of less than 2% are generally
recommended for differentiating binders from non-binders (see `paper <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5679736/>`_`). In contrast to IC50 predictions, percentile ranks allow a more normalized comparison across different HLA alleles that may have allele-specific binding cutoffs. This feature is turned off by default but can be turned on by the user and considered when regenerating Tiering across variants. 
- ``Percentile Threshold`` : percentile score cutoff. (default: NULL)
When using the predicted IC50 values from binding prediction tools, another aspect to consider is the binding threshold of each allele. As stated earlier, different alleles may have allele-specific binding thresholds that vary from the default 500nM cutoff. Users can choose to use allele-specific binding threshold where data is available by turning this option on.
- ``Allele Specific Binding Threshold`` : this dictates whether the binding threshold is set specific to each allele based on `IEDB <https://help.iedb.org/hc/en-us/articles/114094151811-Selecting-thresholds-cut-offs-for-MHC-class-I-and-II-binding-predictions>`_ suggestion (option TRUE), or based on the ``Binding Threshold`` defined above (option FALSE). (default: TRUE)
An important advantage of using pVACseq to generate neoantigen predictions is that multiple algorithms can be run (namely up to 8 Class I algorithms and up to 4 Class II algorithms). However, the user will need to decide whether the lowest or the median prediction value across algorithms should be used as the binding metric (IC50 MT, IC50 WT, %ile MT, and %ile WT columns) for each peptide-HLA combination. To view what score metric (median or lowest) was used to compare binding affinity of mutant (MT) and wildtype (WT) peptides, we provide:
- ``MT Top Score Metric`` : mutant top score metric. (default: Median)
- ``WT Top Score Metric`` : wildtype top score metric. (default: Median)

Anchor positions can influence whether a neoantigen candidate may be recognized by the patientâ€™s immune system. Thus, another aspect to consider is anchor contribution. A subset of  amino acid positions within the neoantigen candidate is more likely to face the TCR, while other positions are responsible for anchoring the peptide to the MHC. Anchor identity is determined by anchor likelihood score (more information about how the score is calculated `here <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abg2200?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed>`_) .Anchor identity of the mutated amino acid can influence whether the neoantigen candidate is expected to induce an immune response or subject to central tolerance of the immune system, as elaborated in the 4 scenarios discussed later. To examine whether the mutated amino acid is located at anchor position, we provide:
- ``Allele Specific Anchors Used`` : if TRUE, likelihood score is used to determine anchor position; if FALSE, position 1, 2, n-1 and n are set as anchor positions. (default: TRUE)
- ``Anchor Contribution Threshold`` : anchor likelihood score (between 0-1) cutoff to determine whether the amino acid is in anchor position. (default: 0.8)
Last but not least, the ``HLA.Alleles`` and respective ``Binding.Cutoffs`` are also displayed.
- ``HLA.Alleles`` : is the list of HLA alleles that the sample expresses and given as input when running pVACseq.
- ``Binding.Cutoffs``: the IC50 cutoff value for the corresponding HLA allele. The default values are from `IEDB <https://help.iedb.org/hc/en-us/articles/114094151811-Selecting-thresholds-cut-offs-for-MHC-class-I-and-II-binding-predictions>`_.

and tailor the parameters as needed. Learn more about Advanced Options `here <https://pvactools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pvacview/getting_started.html#regenerate-tiering>`_.


The second row of the page spans the **Aggregate Report of Best Candidates by Variant** section, which lists all neoantigen candidates in provided input. Candidates with higher Tier will be shown first, followed by candidates of lower Tiers (Order of Tiers: ``Pass``, ``Anchor``, ``Subclonal``, ``Low Expr``, ``NoExpr``, ``Poor``)(see Tiering criteria `here <https://pvactools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pvacseq/output_files.html#tiers>`_). Genes that match with the user-input list of genes of interest will have a green box around them (for example, ARID1B and MSH6 are covered by a green box in this demo). This feature can be useful for highlighting neoantigens derived from cancer driver genes.  

To view the variant, transcript, and peptide level information of a desired candidate, click on the ``Investigate`` button on the right side of the row for that candidate. The candidate currently under investigation will be framed in blue. The number of the currently investigating row is indicated at the bottom of this section.

Next, we will evaluate some neoantigen candidates using the original parameters for Tiering.

Example 1: a good candidate: KIF1C-S433F: TEFQIGPEEA
^^^^^^^^

    :width: 1000px
    :align: right
    :alt: pVACview Vignette
    :figclass: align-left

**Variant-level assessment:**

The variant has good DNA and RNA VAF (the DNA VAF is 0.316, higher than the Subclonal threshold of 0.25, thereby the variant is clonal) . 

In this case, thereâ€™s only 1 mutant transcript matches with the user-provided RNAseq data (``Transcript Sets of Selected Variant`` tab shows only 1 result).

    :width: 1000px
    :align: right
    :alt: pVACview Vignette
    :figclass: align-left
The predicted best peptide (neoantigen candidate) doesnâ€™t have any match in the human proteome. This is ideal, since the candidate will more likely to be recognized by T cells due to central tolerance.

    :width: 1000px
    :align: right
    :alt: pVACview Vignette
    :figclass: align-left

**Transcript-level assessment:**

The variant is detected in only 1 transcript. This transcript has good expression and Transcript Support Level.

    :figclass: align-left

**Protein-level assessment:**

The candidate in investigation has good binding affinity (median IC50 score is less than 500nM, percentile rank is less than 2%). Elution score varies with algorithms but overall the mutant peptide has better elution score than wildtype peptide, and the elution score is close to 1.

The mutation is not in an anchor position (see ``Anchor heatmap`` tab). Anchor prediction scores for each amino acid position are provided in ``Anchor Weights`` tab at the bottom. 
Both mutant and wildtype peptides are good binders, yet the mutant peptide is a stronger binder. This is scenario number 2 (WT strong binder, MT strong binder, MT not in an anchor position) according to the Scenario Guide, where the neoantigen candidate is favorable and can be accepted.

    :figclass: align-left


**Decision:**

Given all the information above, we can conclude that the reviewed Class I peptide is potentially a good binder and choose to Accept this candidate in the ``Eval`` drop-down menu.

    :width: 1000px
    :align: right
    :alt: pVACview Vignette
    :figclass: align-left

**Variant-level assessment:**

The variant has good DNA and RNA VAF (the DNA VAF is 0.302, higher than the Subclonal threshold of 0.25, thereby the variant is clonal) . 

**Transcript-level assessment:**

Here, thereâ€™re 2 transcript sets matching with the user-provided RNAseq data (``Transcript Sets of Selected Variant`` tab shows 2 results). The transcript set highlighted in green (Transcript Set 1 in this case) has the presumably best neoantigen candidate. Transcript Set 1 has 14 transcripts, all of which encode a stretch of amino acids (AERMGFTVVT) which gives rise to 3 different neoantigen candidates: AERMGFTVV, AERMGFTVVT, AERMGFTV. Transcript Set 2 has 1 transcript that encodes a stretch of amino acids (AERMGFTVLP), which gives rise to 3 different neoantigen candidates: AERMGFTVL, AERMGFTVLP, AERMGFTV.

Example 3: a bad candidate: ZNF141-H389Y: KIYTGEKPY
^^^^^^^^

    :width: 1000px
    :align: right
    :alt: pVACview Vignette
    :figclass: align-left

**Variant-level assessment:**

Given that the allele expression for passing variants is set at 2 (and a lot of gene has allele expression in the range of 5-114), ``Allele expression`` of this ZNF141 variant is low (1.824). 

Furthermore, the candidate peptide KIYTGEKPY matches with a sequence in the human reference proteome. 

.. figure:: ../../images/screenshots/vignette/ZNF141/2_ReferenceMatches.png
    :width: 1000px
    :align: right
    :alt: pVACview Vignette
    :figclass: align-left

These potentially problematic characteristics are also flagged by the red boxes at the ``Aggregate report of best candidate by variant`` section.

**Decision:**

Since the candidate peptide has a match in the reference proteome, we will reject this candidate.
