pVACseq
=======

pVACseq is a cancer immunotherapy pipeline for the identification of **p**\ ersonalized **V**\ ariant **A**\ ntigens by **C**\ ancer **Seq**\ uencing (pVACseq)
that integrates tumor mutation and expression data (DNA- and RNA-Seq). It enables cancer immunotherapy research by using massively parallel sequence data to
predict tumor-specific mutant peptides (neoantigens) that can elicit anti-tumor T cell immunity. It is being used in studies of checkpoint therapy response and
to identify targets for personalized cancer vaccines and adoptive T cell therapies. For more general information, see the
`manuscript published in Cancer Immunology Research <https://doi.org/10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-19-0401>`_.
