pVACview
========

pVACview is a R shiny based tool designed to aid specifically in the prioritization and selection of neoantigen candidates for personalized cancer vaccines.
It takes as inputs a pVACseq output aggregate report file (tsv format) and a corresponding pVACseq output metrics file (json).
pVACview allows the user to launch an R shiny application to load and visualize the given neoantigen candidates with detailed information
including that of the genomic variant, transcripts covering the variant, and good-binding peptides predicted from the respective transcripts.
It also incorporates anchor prediction data for a range of class I HLA alleles and peptides ranging from 8 to 11-mers.
By taking all levels of information into account for the neoantigen candidates, clinicians will be able to make more informed
decisions when deciding final peptide candidates for personalized cancer vaccines.
