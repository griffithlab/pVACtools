pVACtools
=========

pVACtools is a cancer immunotherapy tools suite consisting of the following
tools:

**pVACseq**
   A cancer immunotherapy pipeline for identifying and prioritizing neoantigens from a VCF file.

**pVACbind**
   A cancer immunotherapy pipeline for identifying and prioritizing neoantigens from a FASTA file.

**pVACfuse**
   A tool for detecting neoantigens resulting from gene fusions.

**pVACsplice**
   A tool for detecting neoantigens resulting from splice site variants.

**pVACvector**
   A tool designed to aid specifically in the construction of DNA-based
   cancer vaccines.

**pVACview**
   An application based on R Shiny that assists
   users in reviewing, exploring and prioritizing neoantigens from the results of
   pVACtools processes for personalized cancer vaccine design.

New in Release |release|
------------------------

This is a bugfix release. It fixes the following problem(s):

- Previously, pVACview would add an additional header line to Excel spreadsheets
  when exporting a TSV. This has been fixed so that the first line in the spreadsheet
  is the actual header line.
  by @susannasiebert in https://github.com/griffithlab/pVACtools/pull/1143
- One of the pVACview figures used to describe various anchor scenarios has been updated
  so that the ordering of the scenarios is consistent with other figures and descriptions
  throughout. Screenshots and documentation has been updated appropriately.
  by @susannasiebert in https://github.com/griffithlab/pVACtools/pull/1144
- The class II pVACview demo data was out-of-date and not reflecting recent updates to the
  HLA alpha-beta chain handling. This file has now been updated.
