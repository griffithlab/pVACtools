pVACtools
=========

pVACtools is a cancer immunotherapy tools suite consisting of the following
tools:

**pVACseq**
   A cancer immunotherapy pipeline for identifying and prioritizing neoantigens from a VCF file.

**pVACbind**
   A cancer immunotherapy pipeline for identifying and prioritizing neoantigens from a FASTA file.

**pVACfuse**
   A tool for detecting neoantigens resulting from gene fusions.

**pVACvector**
   A tool designed to aid specifically in the construction of DNA-based
   cancer vaccines.

**pVACview**
   An application based on R Shiny that assists
   users in reviewing, exploring and prioritizing neoantigens from the results of
   pVACtools processes for personalized cancer vaccine design.

New in Release |release|
------------------------

This is a bugfix release. It fixes the following problem(s):

- It fixes an issue with parsing class II IEDB output files when running
  pVACfuse or pVACbind, which resulted in the wrong binding prediction scores
  being associated with certain epitopes.
- It adds missing import statements to pVACvector.

New in Version |version|
------------------------

This release adds the following new features:

- When running the pipelines with the ``--netmhc-stab`` flag enabled, the
  ``NetMHCstab allele`` column now also reports the distance of the
  NetMHCstabpan allele when that allele is not identical to the ``HLA Allele``
  of the original result.
- When running the pipelines with a set of individual class II alleles, the pipeline now
  also auto-generates valid combinations of these alleles so that users no
  longer need to explicitly provide these combinations.

This release also fixes the following problem(s):

- Some class I alleles are not supported by NetMHCstabpan and will lead to an
  error when attempt to make predictions with them. This release will skip
  such alleles for the stability prediction step.
- For very large result sets the filtering steps would stall or be killed
  because the steps would run out of memory. This release fixes this issue.
- This release adds better handling of timeout errors while running
