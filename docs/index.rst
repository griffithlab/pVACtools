pVACtools
=========

pVACtools is a cancer immunotherapy tools suite consisting of the following
tools:

**pVACseq**
   A cancer immunotherapy pipeline for identifying and prioritizing neoantigens from a VCF file.

**pVACbind**
   A cancer immunotherapy pipeline for identifying and prioritizing neoantigens from a FASTA file.

**pVACfuse**
   A tool for detecting neoantigens resulting from gene fusions.

**pVACvector**
   A tool designed to aid specifically in the construction of DNA-based
   cancer vaccines.

**pVACview**
   An application based on R Shiny that assists
   users in reviewing, exploring and prioritizing neoantigens from the results of
   pVACtools processes for personalized cancer vaccine design.

New in Release |release|
------------------------

This release adds the following new features:

- When running the pipelines with the ``--netmhc-stab`` flag enabled, the
  ``NetMHCstab allele`` column now also reports the distance of the
  NetMHCstabpan allele when that allele is not identical to the ``HLA Allele``
  of the original result.
- When running the pipelines with a set of individual class II alleles, the pipeline now
  also auto-generates valid combinations of these alleles so that users no
  longer need to explicitly provide these combinations.

This release also fixes the following problem(s):

- Some class I alleles are not supported by NetMHCstabpan and will lead to an
  error when attempt to make predictions with them. This release will skip
  such alleles for the stability prediction step.
- For very large result sets the filtering steps would stall or be killed
  because the steps would run out of memory. This release fixes this issue.
- This release adds better handling of timeout errors while running
  NetMHCstabpan and/or NetChop.

New in Version |version|
------------------------

This version adds the following features, outlined below. Please note that
pVACtools 3.0 is not backwards-compatible and certain changes will break old
workflows.

Breaking Changes
________________

- The pVACapi and pVACviz tools have been removed. They have been replaced by
  the :ref:`pvacview` tool.
- The package namespace has been updated. The files will now be installed
  underneath a ``pvactools`` directory in your python package installation
  path.
- The aggregated report format has been updated. The headers have been updated for
  clarity. An additional column ``Allele Expr`` has been added, representing
  RNA expression * RNA VAF. For more information see :ref:`aggregated`.
- pVACfuse no longer supports inputs from Integrate NEO. Only AGFusion inputs
  will be supported going forward.
- The format of the pVACfuse all_epitopes and filtered reports has been updated to
  remove columns that aren't applicable for the tool. Please see the documentation
  for the pVACfuse :ref:`pvacfuse_all_ep_and_filtered` for more information.

New Features
____________

- This release adds a new tool, :ref:`pvacview`. pVACview is an R Shiny application that
  allows for that visualization of the pVACseq aggregated report file to review, explore,
  and prioritize the different neoantigen candidates predicted by pVACseq.
- The 3.0 release adds several improvements to the reference proteome
  similarity step:

  - Users can now run the reference proteome similarity step with a standalone
    Protein BLAST installation. To use a standalone BLASTp installation, provide the
    installation path using the ``--blastp-path`` parameter. The supported
    Protein BLAST databases are ``refseq_select_prot`` and ``refseq_protein``.
    Please reference the :ref:`blast` documentation for further instructions.
  - When running the reference proteome similarity step using the NCBI Protein BLAST API,
    users can now pick between the ``refseq_select_prot`` and ``refseq_protein``
    databases.
  - Parallelization has been added to the reference proteome similarity step.
    When running this step as part of the pVACseq, pVACfuse, or pVACbind
    pipelines, the existing ``--t`` parameter will also be used to set the number of
    parallel threads in this step.

- This release adds standalone commands to run stability predictions, cleavage
  site predictions, and the reference proteome similarity step on the output
  of the :ref:`pVACseq<optional_downstream_analysis_tools_label>`, :ref:`pVACfuse<pvacfuse_tools>`, and :ref:`pVACbind<pvacbind_tools>` pipelines.

Minor Updates
_____________

- Previously, when running NetChop for cleavage site predictions, predictions
  were made for each epitope individually. However, these predictions will
  differ if additional flanking amino acids are provided and will be stable
  with 9 or more flanking amino acids. We updated this step to make predictions
  with 9 flanking amino acids around each epitope to generate stable
  predictions.
- This release adds a ``--species`` option to the ``valid_alleles`` commands
  to filter alleles on a species of interest.
- This release adds a ``--pass-only`` flag to the ``pvacseq
  generate_protein_fasta`` commands to only process VCF entries that do not
  have a FILTER set.
- This release adds a new parameter ``--tumor-purity``. This parameter indicates
  the fraction of tumor cells in the tumor sample and is used during aggregate
  report creation for a simple estimation whether variants are subclonal or clonal based on VAF.
